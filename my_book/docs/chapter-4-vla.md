- **Bipedal locomotion and balance control**:
  - Advanced control algorithms for stable walking and running.
  - Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and Capture Point (CP) theory for balance.
  - Recovering from disturbances and maintaining stability.
- **Manipulation and grasping**:
  - End-effector design and gripper mechanics.
  - Grasp planning and force control for delicate objects.
  - Dexterous manipulation with multi-fingered hands.
- **Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper**:
  - Integrating OpenAI Whisper for robust speech-to-text conversion.
  - Real-time audio processing and transcription.
  - Handling noisy environments and multiple speakers.
- **Speech recognition and processing**:
  - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for interpreting spoken commands.
