# Chapter 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Coverage**: Weeks 3-5

**Topics**:
- **What is ROS 2 and why it matters**:
  - The evolution from ROS 1 to ROS 2, addressing modern robotics challenges.
  - Key advantages: DDS for real-time communication, security, multi-robot support, and embedded systems compatibility.
  - Use cases in autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and humanoid robotics.
- **ROS 2 architecture: nodes, topics, services, actions**:
  - **Nodes**: The fundamental processing units in ROS 2.
  - **Topics**: Asynchronous, many-to-many communication for data streams.
  - **Services**: Synchronous, request-response communication for specific tasks.
  - **Actions**: Long-running, goal-based tasks with feedback and preemption capabilities.
- **Installing ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04**:
  - Step-by-step guide for setting up the development environment.
  - Understanding different installation methods (binaries, source).
  - Environment setup and sourcing the ROS 2 environment.
- **Creating your first node in Python with rclpy**:
  - Introduction to `rclpy`, the Python client library for ROS 2.
  - Writing a simple publisher and subscriber node.
  - Compiling and running a basic ROS 2 Python package.
- **Publisher-subscriber communication patterns**:
  - In-depth look at message types, QoS settings, and data serialization.
  - Implementing complex data flows between multiple nodes.
  - Tools for inspecting topic communication (`ros2 topic info`, `ros2 topic echo`).
- **Building ROS 2 packages**:
  - Understanding `colcon` build system and workspace management.
  - Creating `package.xml` and `setup.py` files for Python packages.
  - Managing dependencies and cross-package communication.
- **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids**:
  - Defining robot geometry, kinematics, and visual properties.
  - Understanding joints, links, and coordinate frames.
  - Visualizing URDF models in RViz2.
- **Launch files and parameter management**:
  - Orchestrating multiple nodes and processes with Python launch files.
  - Passing parameters to nodes and dynamic parameter reconfiguration.
  - Grouping nodes and managing node lifecycles.
- **Hands-on: Build a multi-node robot control system**:
  - Practical exercise combining all learned concepts to control a simulated robot.
  - Designing a modular system with separate nodes for perception, planning, and control.
  - Debugging and optimizing the multi-node system.
