PROMPT_TEXT:
now connect these chapters with book in app
RESPONSE_TEXT:
I have updated the `sidebars.js` file to integrate the new chapters and resource files into the book's navigation structure. The new chapters will now appear in the sidebar under 'Book Chapters', and the hardware and resources files will be under 'Hardware and Resources'.
